This [repository](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/) contains comprehensive AI examples, metablocks, blueprints, accelerators, and patterns to reference for your use. 

# [AI](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/ai/)

XMPro AI notebooks and Data Stream can be imported into your environment, providing a starting point for configuring your own solutions.

# [Metablocks](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/metablocks/)

XMPro's Metablock is a pro-code customization tool that enables developers to embed dynamic, interactive components into application pages using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This feature transforms XMPro's low-code platform into an extensible environment for advanced real-time applications.

Metablocks allow for the creation of highly tailored and interactive components. By connecting these blocks to your own data sources, you can configure solutions that seamlessly integrate with XMPro Data Streams and data sources. Metablocks offers a way to extend the functionality of XMPro, enabling advanced customization and real-time data interaction.

Developers can:
- Create specialized visualizations like 3D engineering models using Autodesk Platform Services
- Build AI-powered interfaces with dynamic data feeds
- Implement custom dashboards beyond standard grid layouts

# [Blueprints](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/blueprints/)

XMPro Blueprints are pre-built solutions that combine data streams, app visualizations, recommendation rules and models. They are easy to import into your XMPro environment, configure with your business systems and customize to your unique situation.

# [Accelerators](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/accelerators/)

XMPro Accelerators can be imported into your environment, providing a starting point for configuring your own solutions.

# [Patterns](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/patterns/)

XMPro Patterns are pre-configured data streams that serve as building blocks for your digital twin applications. They provide a streamlined way to connect, process, and visualize data from various sources, making it easier to integrate and analyze information within your XMPro environment.
