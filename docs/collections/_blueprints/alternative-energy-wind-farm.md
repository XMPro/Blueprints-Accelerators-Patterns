## Application
An overall view of the wind farm with interactive panning between live 3D wind turbine assets. Live and historic energy generation is displayed alongside the real-time wind speed and direction information for contextual energy management. A list of turbine assets showing status allow's users to drilldown to a single turbine view with performance monitoring and maintenance history detail.The application is configured using:

## Steps to Import

### 1. Create/confirm variables
Ensure the following variables are available to be used in the data stream:
- App Designer URL
- App Designer Integration Key <strong>(Encrypted)</strong>


### 2. Import SQL Tables
- Execute SQL files so that the `DemoAlternativeEnergyAIResults` and `DemoWorkManagementWindTurbine` tables are present and contain data.


### 3. Import the Data Streams
Follow the guide for applicable parts:
- Select the highest agent version number on import, if prompted
- Assign Access to others as required
- <strong>XMPro agents</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/xmpro_app.webp" %}) - ensure the URL & Integration Key are selected
- <strong>Recommendation agent</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/run_recommendation.webp" %}) - ensure the URL & Integration Key are selected
- <strong>Read Recommendation</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/run_recommendation.webp" %}) - Do not configure yet, this will be configured once the recommendation is imported
- <strong>SQL Context Provider</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/SQL.png" %}) - ensure the correct SQL credentials are entered.
- Click Apply and save the data stream
- Publish the data stream and open the live view
- Ensure there is data in the live view by monitoring the agents


### 4. Import the Recommendations

Map the data stream to import

  | Recommendation Name               | Category                      | Data Stream                |
  | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
  | Wind Condition Monitoring         | Renewable (or own choice)     | Wind Turbine Data          |

<br>
Assign Access to others as required
  {% include framework/shortcodes/image.html src="/assets/images/blueprints/alternative-energy-wind-farm/rmAccess.png" %}


### 5. Set Read Recommendation Agents

Configure the following Read Recommendation agents along with the URL and Key fields:

#### 5.1 Data for Wind Farm
**Recommendation:** Wind Condition Monitoring<br>
**Rules:** *All*


### 6. Import the Application

<br>


- Assign Access to others as required
  {% include framework/shortcodes/image.html src="/assets/images/blueprints/alternative-energy-wind-farm/adAccess.png" %}
- Ensure the App Data connection properties are configured and valid
- Edit the application to link the recommendations - Select all recommendations mentioned in this guide.

  | Page                        | Location           | Entity ID           |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
  | 1.0 Landing Page            | Bottom Right       | null                |
  | 2.0 Drilldown               | Bottom Right       | Variable.assetId    |
